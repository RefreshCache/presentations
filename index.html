					<h3>So what is this place?</h3>
					
					<p>In case you're wondering, this is the "gh-pages" branch of the RefreshCache/Presentations project in Github. It basically a Jekyll powered site that uses Markdown.  You can even check out this branch:</p>
					
					<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
					$ git fetch origin
					$ git checkout gh-pages
					</code></pre>
					
					<p>Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
					
					<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>
